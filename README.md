# [EfficientFCN: Holistically-Guided Decoding for Semantic Segmentation (ECCV20)]


## Introduction
We propose a holistically-guided decoder (HGD) for achieving discriminative deep feature
representations. With the proposed HGD, our EfficientFCN method for semantic segmentation 
achieves comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods with only 
1/3 of their computational costs on PASCAL Context, PASCAL VOC and ADE20K datasets.

Recently, we integrate the proposed HGD into the original FPN architecture to implement one
novel FPN-variant [HGD-FPN](https://github.com/jianbo909/HGD_FPN) for object detection.
